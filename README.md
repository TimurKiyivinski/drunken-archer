- Compile: make
- Created for my Object Oriented Programming in C++ Classes.
- This project is severely boring.
- Do not question the code, I'm doing purely what is instructed.
- If my lecturer sees this, he will probably kill me. Or not.
- If I do die, do not bother continueing this project in my name.
- I should get to bed.
